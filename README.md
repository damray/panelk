# PAN-OS Elk integration

Initial work on PAN-OS integration with ELK

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### System

**Minimum**
- CPU: 2 cores
- RAM: 4GB

**Recommanded**
- CPU: 4 cores
- RAM: 8GB

#### Software

- linux based os (tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS)
- docker
- docker compose

### Installation

#### Server software required

##### Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

Installation on Ubuntu LTS 18.04
```
sudo apt install docker docker-compose git -y
git clone https://github.com/damray/panelk
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
cd panelk
```
##### Other Linux version

You must download the latest version of docker-compose to interpret the version 3.2 of our docker-compose.yml
You can read the official installation doc [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

We advise to check where is your actual docker-compose :
```
whereis docker-compose
```
After you can replace the path in the code of the installation docker-compose :
```
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.5/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

#### Add the user to the docker group

To avoid to use the sudo command and launch the different container in root, you can add your user to the docker group :
```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

#### Change the login and password

To modify the default login/password (elastic/changeme) you can edit the file and modify :
```
vim editme.env
```

#### Launch PANELK and wait few minute

Launch docker-compose to download all images and scripts.
Be careful, if you use ctrl+c it will stop the containers. Launch it in detach mode add -d to your command

```
docker-compose up
```
You will see a lot of logs and check everything is ok, if you use ctrl+c it will stop the container. if you want to launch in detach mode add -d to your command

```
docker-compose up -d
```
Elastic Search is now ready to be used and will restart automatically if your server reboot accidentally


Elastic Search is now ready to be used.

#### Use as a syslog

On your Panorama or PAN-OS, create a new log forwarding profile to send all your logs to your newly created ELK stack.

To do so you can open a policy rule and go the the *Actions* tab en edit the *Log Settings*:

![Log Profile 1](https://github.com/damray/panelk/blob/master/images/log_profile-1.png)

Add a new *Profile*:

![Log Profile 2](https://github.com/damray/panelk/blob/master/images/log_profile-2.png)

Click on *Add* to add a new *Profile match*:

![Log Profile 3](https://github.com/damray/panelk/blob/master/images/log_profile-3.png)

Give a name, select a log type, here *traffic*, and add a syslog server:

![Log Profile 4](https://github.com/damray/panelk/blob/master/images/log_profile-4.png)

Add a new *Syslog Profile* by clicking on the + in the *Syslog* frame:

![Log Profile 5](https://github.com/damray/panelk/blob/master/images/log_profile-5.png)

Add your elk server using the information gathered previously, and change the *Tranport* and *Port* to **UDP or TCP 5514**:

![Log Profile 6](https://github.com/damray/panelk/blob/master/images/log_profile-6.png)

Add the remaining categories, *auth*, *data*, *threat*, *tunnel*, *url* and *wildfire* and click *OK*.
You should end up with the *Log Forwarding Profile* as below:

![Log Profile 7](https://github.com/damray/panelk/blob/master/images/log_profile-7.png)

Do the same for Device > Log Settings to send the System, Configuration, User-ID, HIP Match, GlobalProtect and IP-Tag

![Log Profile 8](https://github.com/damray/panelk/blob/master/images/log_profile-8.png)

Give a name to the *Log Settings* for each category, and add the *Syslog* server:

![Log Profile 9](https://github.com/damray/panelk/blob/master/images/log_profile-9.png)

Commit your changes to send the logs to the PAN ELK server.


### Log on on Kibana

Launch a web browser and use the ip address of your ubuntu server:
```
http://YOURIPADDRESS:5601
```

## How to use panelk with other log sources

### Kibana changes

We recommend that you save your dashboard and visualization as new when customizing Kibana.
Then export your objects to have a backup in case your volume is erased.

### Logstash changes

We recommend to create a local branch so your configuration will not be stashed during a git pull to update the origin.
Type *git branch "your branch name"* to create a new branch, and then change to this new environment with a checkout.

```
git branch changes
git checkout changes
```

To add the updated modification from the official repository merge Panelk changes to your branch with this command:
```
git merge master
```

If you need to change back to the master branch enter the following command:
```
git checkout master
```

### Change the current configuration

**docker-compose.yml**

list of ports logstash is listening on:
```
 logstash:
    ...
    ports:
      - "5000:5000/tcp"
      - "5000:5000/udp"
      - "5514:5514/tcp"
      - "5514:5514/udp"
      - "9600:9600"
```

**logstash/pipeline/logstash.conf**

Either change the configuration to add filters and output

**OR**

Add another .conf file to the logstash pipeline folder. All files in the folder will be read by logstash.

## To Do
​
**Next steps**
- [x] Global Protect for 9.1
- [x] Global Protect for 9.0 and below
- [x] Panos Threat logs
- [ ] Integrate Beat to use SIEM module and normalization
- [ ] Add certificate init
- [ ] Improve Threat and URL Information

## DRAFT CHAPTER

## How to clean everything and delete all docker image on your host
if you need to change mapping, you have to create a new index to use your new mapping in ES or because it's docker and if you dont mind to lose all your log you can reset all docker volume and image :

From the directory panelk
```
docker-compose down --volumes
docker rmi -f $(docker image ls -aq)
```

## Waiting for ES and Kibana to be "healthy"
In the Docker compose the panelk is configured to wait for the ElasticSearch and Kibana container to startup and be ready to accept requests before continuing :

The following healthcheck has been configured to periodically check if ES and Kibana are ready using the `curl` command. See the documentation for `ElasticSearch` command [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/app-pg-isready.html).
```yml
healthcheck:
  test: curl -s -f http://elastic:changeme@localhost:9200/_cat/health; if [[ $$? == 52 ]]; then echo 0; else echo 1; fi
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 5
```
If the check is successful the container will be marked as `healthy`. Until then it will remain in an `unhealthy` state.
For more details about the healthcheck parameters `interval`, `timeout` and `retries` see the documentation [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck).

The container "curl" will configure ElasticSearch and Kibana when the 2 container healthcheck will bi `healthy`. The Curl Services depend on ES and Kibana and can be configured with the `depends_on` parameter as follows:
```yml
depends_on:
  kibana:
    condition: service_healthy
```
It's will be also possible to create a chain, ElasticSearch < Logstash < Kibana < Curl

There is a last container with the service name setup_panelk who execute a script.

The script check if ELK is alive and push several configuration :
- [x] object with index pattern
- [x] dashboard
- [x] elastic mapping template Threat and Traffic
- [x] elastic mapping template URL and GP
- [x] elastic index creation
- [x] Kibana dashboard
​
#### //NOT AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT // Create Certificat for communication and Random password user

Generate the certificates (only needed once):

```
docker-compose -f create-certs.yml run --rm create_certs
```

Access Elasticsearch API Over SSL/TLS user the bootstrap password
```
docker run --rm -v es_certs:/certs --network=es_default docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.6.2 curl --cacert /certs/ca/ca.crt -u elastic:PleaseChangeMe https://es01:9200
```

The elasticsearch-setup-passwords tool can also be used to generate random passwords for all users:
```
docker exec es01 /bin/bash -c "bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords \
auto --batch \
--url https://localhost:9200"
```
